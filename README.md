SCREAM: Sprint Car Racing: Evolved Action on Mud

As a Lifetime Sprint Car (Sprintcar) fan and geek, combined with the privelege 
of being Born and raised next door to Premier Speedway, Warrnambool, home of the Classic, 
i have been wanting to create this game for years now....and finally that journey has started!
 
It'll always be free as I will be releasing the core assets and code under The Creative Commons Licence. (CC-BY-SA)
It's my personal thank you to the speedway community for providing such a great outlet and for 
the infinite entertainment and action over the years. 
Let's Go Racing!
