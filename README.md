INTRODUCTION
=========================
As a Lifetime Sprint Car (Sprintcar) fan and geek,
combined with the privilege of being Born and raised
next door to Premier Speedway, Warrnambool, home of the Classic,
I have wanted to create this game for a long time....
Finally, that journey has started!
Introducing...
SCREAM: Sprint Car Racing: Evolved Action on Mud
It'll always be free as the core assets and code are released

It's my personal thank you to the speedway community for providing
such a great outlet and for the infinite entertainment and action
over the years.
Let's Go Racing!
