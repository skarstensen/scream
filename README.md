As a Lifetime Sprint Car (Sprintcar) fan and geek, combined with the privilege of being Born and raised next door to Premier Speedway, Warrnambool,I have wanted to create this game for a long time....

Finally, that journey has started! And It'll always be free as the core assets and code are being released under the Creative Commons Licence. (CC-BY-SA)

It's my personal thank you to the speedway community for providing such a great outlet and for the infinite entertainment and action over the years. Let's Go Racing!
