SCREAM: Sprint Car Racing: Evolved Action on Mud

Let's  go  racing; 
Feel the engines scream,
Dirt track dancing pilots; 
Duelling for "The Dream".
Elbows up; right foot down; 
Turn it left; Hear that growl.
Biffs 'n' Bops;	
Thrills 'n' Spills;
Til run 'n' won. 
Oh, What a thrill.

As a Lifetime Sprint Car (Sprintcar) fan and geek,  Born and raised next door to Premier Speedway, Warrnambool.

#Premier Speedway has its own sprint car racing game thanks to one dedicated fan

A Koroit game developer has released a sprint car racing game featuring
drivers, sponsors and commentary from the Premier Speedway community.

SCREAM - Sprint Car Racing Evolved Action on Mud is a free, open-source video
game for fans of the open-wheel format. Developer Mahda Christopher Greene-Moon
has been going to the speedway for around 30 years and first had the idea for
the game when he was 14 years old.

"Speedway has a great family atmosphere and I just love what it's trying to
promote," he told The Standard.

The game includes a number of real-world businesses and drivers, such as Junior
Formula 500 driver Koby O'Shannassy. "I got in touch with the team and they
were so keen to have his sprint car in the game," Mr Greene-Moon said.

The cars of Tim Van Ginneken, David Donegan and Johnny Vogels are also included
in the game's lineup. SCREAM features commentary from Premier Speedway track
announcer Gavin White, recorded live with his blessing.

"I've only got a little bit of commentary in at the moment but the next update
should have a lot more." IN OTHER NEWS Mr Greene-Moon said he was blown away
with the positive feedback the game had received. "I'm stoked with where it's
at, but this is just the beginning for development," he said.

"There's still quite a few bugs with the AI but that's the fun part of working
on this, to see how good it can get." The game's extensive roadmap details
plans for a time trial mode, track wear, online multiplayer and a dynamic
weather system in future updates. Mr Greene-Moon said he'd also like to include
the tracks at Lang, Darlington, Simpson, Portland, Redline and Horsham.

"I'm keen to add any other tracks or clubs that want to get on board,
especially the smaller ones that don't get as much focus," he said. "The
community spirit at Speedway starts from these grassroot tracks, so I'll do
anything to support them."

Mr Greene-Moon said he'd been working on SCREAM in his free time for the last
few years, experimenting with different game engines. Ultimately, he decided to
release the game's code publicly to "cut through the commercialism of the
industry". "Hopefully some people can learn from it and build some awesome
stuff as well," he said.

"I'll continue to work on and update the game as often as I can." SCREAM can be
